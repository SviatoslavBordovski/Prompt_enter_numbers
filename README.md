# promp-enter-numbers
Program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. Link https://www.py4e.com/tools/pythonauto/?PHPSESSID=71f4fb40dcb61aa18cea57c9c12685d8

Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.
