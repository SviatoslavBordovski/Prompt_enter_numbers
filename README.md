<h1>Prompt enter numbers</h1>
<br>
<p>Program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'.</p>

<h2>Program workflow is:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers</li>
  <li>if the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and     ignore the number</li>
  <li>Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals:</h3> 
<p>:white_check_mark: Remember all the values user enters the number it is remembered by the program.</p>
<br>
<p>:white_check_mark: Figure out and record to memory the <b>maximum</b> and <b>minimum</b> numbers.</p>
<br>
<p>:white_check_mark: Error validation for anything that is not a number entered by the user.</p>
